# SpaceBox
A minimalistic OpenGL implementation of Asteroid shooting game. 


Asteroids is an arcade space shooter released by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg. 

The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.

SpaceBox is a novice attempt to implement similar gameplay in OpenGL.
